# AI Theory
This repository is meant to be a comprehensive guide of the theoretical concepts of Artificial Intelligence. 

I will cover a wide range of topics within the AI field, including the mathematical explanation of generalised practices and more in-depth insights of what is actually occurring. I will also provide guides and methodical ways for practical projects.

Said writings will also be uploaded on my Medium page, so please feel free to take a look over there as well!! :))

# Goals

The goal of this repo is aiding you becoming more knowledgeable about AI as possible. While I cannot assure whether you will become proficient at the subject or not, since it's up to you to put the hard work in, I can only provide useful information you can extensively utilise as either main source or supplementary (I always recommend to have a cross-source learning approach) for your studies or research.

I will try to be as clear as possible in my writings, so that **anybody**, regardless of their background, can understand and learn from the proposed concepts. 


# Use Case

You can utilise this repo in different ways: 

1) Gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental theory aspects of Artificial Intelligence.
2) Learning how to apply said low-level information into real-world problems (you can also check my projects, constituited of detailed comments).
3) Learning AI from beginner to advanced, building the necessary field-related knowledge on the go.

**N.B**: The articles will be structured this way: Introductionary part (for Beginners and/or those who don't possess the requirements said below but still want to learn more about AI), A small more in-depth explanation (for those individuals who don't have all the requirements filled yet, but on an Intermediate level) and finally the rigorous explanation of the topic at-hand (here, it is expected a strong foundation in the requirements stated below, from the reader).

Additionally, keep in mind that many concepts we're going to explore are crossed, meaning that they can be used multiple times throughout the journey. Therefore, I strong advice anybody's interested in reading the whole guides from start to finish to avoid missing any essential part.

# Requirements

In order to get the best off of this educational repo, you'll need to possess certain requirements and skills beforehand:

1) Math (if you have mastered the basics of Algebra, Linear Algebra and Calculus, that can be enough).
2) Computer Science.

If you don't have them, **DON'T WORRY**! I will provide educational repo on those matters as well.
