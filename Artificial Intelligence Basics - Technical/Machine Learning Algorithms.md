### Section 1: Advances in Supervised Learning

#### Introduction to Supervised Learning

Supervised learning, a predominant branch of machine learning, involves training a model to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs. This approach hinges on using labeled datasets, where each training sample is paired with an annotation that the model aims to predict. The cardinal goal is to devise a model that generalizes well to unseen data, thereby making predictions or decisions with high accuracy.

Mathematically, supervised learning can be described as learning a function $( f: X \rightarrow Y )$ from labeled training data consisting of pairs $((x_i, y_i))$ where $(x_i \in X)$ and $(y_i \in Y)$. The aim is to minimize some loss function $( L )$ that measures the difference between the predicted value $( f(x) )$ and the actual value $( y )$.

#### Recent Algorithms in Supervised Learning

##### 1. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)

Gradient Boosting Machines, including popular implementations like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, have revolutionized decision-making tasks. GBM is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

The general algorithm involves:
- Initializing the model with a constant value:
  
  $$F_0(x) = \arg \min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \gamma)$$

- For each subsequent model $( t = 1 ) \to ( T )$:
  - Computing the pseudo-residuals:
    
    $$ r_{it} = -\left[ \frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)} \right]_{F=F_{t-1}} $$
  
  - Fitting a base learner (e.g., decision tree) to these residuals.
  - Updating the model:
    
    $$ F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + \eta \cdot h_t(x) $$
  
  where \( \eta \) is the learning rate and \( h_t(x) \) is the output of the base learner.
  
- The output for a new input \( x \) is given by:
  \[
  F(x) = F_T(x) = F_0(x) + \sum_{t=1}^T \eta \cdot h_t(x)
  \]

##### 2. Deep Learning Techniques: CNNs and RNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have profoundly impacted fields like image and speech recognition. CNNs are particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data (e.g., images), using convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies:
- Layers in a CNN may include convolutional layers, activation functions (like ReLU), pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- The convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, capturing patterns via filters.

Recurrent Neural Networks address data with a sequential nature (e.g., text, audio):
- An RNN processes sequences by maintaining a state (memory) that captures information about previous elements in the sequence.
- Basic computation in a unit of RNN can be formulated as:
  \[
  h_t = \text{tanh}(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b)
  \]
  Here, \( W_{hh} \) and \( W_{xh} \) are weight matrices, \( h_t \) is the hidden state at time \( t \), \( x_t \) is the input at time \( t \), and \( b \) is a bias term.
