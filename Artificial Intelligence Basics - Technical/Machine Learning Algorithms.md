# Section 1: Advances in Supervised Learning

### Introduction to Supervised Learning

Supervised learning, a predominant branch of machine learning, involves training a model to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs. This approach hinges on using labeled datasets, where each training sample is paired with an annotation that the model aims to predict. The cardinal goal is to devise a model that generalizes well to unseen data, thereby making predictions or decisions with high accuracy.

Mathematically, supervised learning can be described as learning a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ from labeled training data consisting of pairs $(x_i, y_i)$ where $x_i \in X$ and $y_i \in Y$. The aim is to minimize some loss function $L$ that measures the difference between the predicted value $f(x)$ and the actual value $y$.

### 1. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)

Gradient Boosting Machines, including popular implementations like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, have revolutionized decision-making tasks. GBM is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

The general algorithm involves:
- Initializing the model with a constant value:
  
  $$F_0(x) = \arg \min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \gamma)$$

- For each subsequent model $t = 1 \to T$:
  - Computing the pseudo-residuals:

    $$r_{it} = -\frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)} \Biggr|\_{F=F_{t-1}}$$
  
  - Fitting a base learner (e.g., decision tree) to these residuals.
  - Updating the model:
    
    $$F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + \eta \cdot h_t(x)$$
  
  where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $h_t(x)$ is the output of the base learner.
  
- The output for a new input $x$ is given by:

  $$F(x) = F_T(x) = F_0(x) + \sum_{t=1}^T \eta \cdot h_t(x)$$


### 2. Deep Learning Techniques: CNNs and RNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have profoundly impacted fields like image and speech recognition. CNNs are particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data (e.g., images), using convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies (it will be studied later in more depth):
- Layers in a CNN may include convolutional layers, activation functions (like ReLU), pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- The convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, capturing patterns via filters.

Recurrent Neural Networks address data with a sequential nature (e.g., text, audio):
- An RNN processes sequences by maintaining a state (memory) that captures information about previous elements in the sequence.
- Basic computation in a unit of RNN can be formulated as:
  
  $$h_t = \text{tanh}(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b)$$
  
  Here,  $W_{hh}$ and $W_{xh}$ are weight matrices, $h_t$ is the hidden state at time $t$, $x_t$ is the input at time $t$, and $b$ is a bias term.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.

To understand SVMs, let us consider a binary classification problem. Given a labeled training dataset $\{(\mathbf{x}\_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^m$ where $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $y_i \in \{-1,1}$, SVMs aim at finding the optimal separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes.

The equation of the hyperplane can be written as:
$$\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b = 0$$
where $\mathbf{w}$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane and $b$ is the bias.

The goal is to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest points from each class, which are termed support vectors. This margin is given by the distance $\frac{2}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$. Thus, the problem can be formulated as:

$\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2$
subject to the constraint that all data points are correctly classified, i.e.,
$y_i (\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1, \quad \text{for all } i$.

One powerful feature of SVMs is the use of kernels, which allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. This significantly increases the flexibility and power of SVMs in handling nonlinear classification. A kernel function transforms the training data into a higher dimensional space where a linear separator might be more effective or even perfect for separation. Common kernels include:

- Linear: $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) = \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_j$
- Polynomial: $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) = (\gamma \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_j + r)^d$, parameters $\gamma, r$, and $d$
- Radial Basis Function (RBF): $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) = \exp(-\gamma \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|^2)$, parameter $\gamma$

For solving the constrained optimization problem, methods such as Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) are used to efficiently find the optimal weights \( \mathbf{w} \) and bias \( b \). The solution involves only a subset of the training points (the support vectors), which makes the decision function depend only on the inner products of the input vectors.

SVMs are particularly well-appreciated for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. They are widely used in applications such as:

- Image recognition and classification
- Text categorization
- Bioinformatics (e.g., classification of proteins, gene classification)
- Handwriting recognition

### 5. Decision Trees & Random Forests

Decision Trees are a supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. The goal of a Decision Tree is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

A Decision Tree is constructed from a root node and splits into branches and internal nodes, each representing a decision based on one of the input features. The leaves of the tree represent the outcome (output class for classification, continuous value for regression).

To build a Decision Tree, recursively split the data set starting from the root, choosing the splits that maximally decrease a certain impurity measure. The most common measures are:

- **Gini Impurity:** Used for classification, it measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. The Gini impurity of a set is calculated using:
  
  $$I_G(f) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2$$

  where $p_i$ is the probability of an item with label $i$ being chosen.

- **Entropy:** Another measure for classification, it quantifies the amount of uncertainty (or randomness) in the data set. Entropy is defined as:
  
  $$H(T) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2(p_i)$$

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used for regression tasks. It measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value:
  
  $$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$$

  where $Y_i$ is the true value and $\hat{Y}_i$ is the predicted value by the tree.

The split for each node is chosen based on the feature and threshold that result in the greatest reduction in impurity or error after the split. Algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees) will evaluate every possible split on every feature.

Random Forests expand upon the concept of Decision Trees, addressing their main limitation: overfitting to the training dataset. This is achieved by creating an ensemble of Decision Trees where each tree is built from a bootstrap sample of the data and using random subsets of features for each split.

Random Forests apply the bootstrapping technique:
1. A bootstrap sample: Randomly select $N$ samples from the training data with replacement.
2. Construct a Decision Tree using the bootstrap sample. For each split, rather than searching all features, a random subset of $m$ features is considered (where $m \leq \text{total features}$)).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 multiple times to create an ensemble of trees.

Random Forests inherently perform feature importance:
- Features consistently used at the top of trees (near the root) affect a larger portion of data and are deemed more important.
- By averaging the reduction in impurity over all trees in the forest for each feature, one can rank the features' importance.

For classification:
- Each tree in the forest makes a vote for the class.
- The class with the most votes becomes the modelâ€™s prediction.

For regression:
- Each tree in the forest predicts a continuous value.
- The final model output is the average of these values.

Decision Trees and Random Forests are versatile algorithms used across various sectors like finance for fraud detection, health sector for patient diagnosis, and commerce for customer behavior analysis. Their interpretability (especially Decision Trees) and robustness to outliers and non-linear data (attributed more to Random Forests) make them favorable choices among other machine learning algorithms

## Regularization

Regularization is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning to prevent overfitting, where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data. By adding a penalty or constraint to the learning algorithm, regularization can enhance the generalization ability of the model.
