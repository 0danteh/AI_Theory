# How AI is Transforming Our World

Artificial Intelligence is becoming more and more popular the more time passes, and people have used this term to refer to everything that is machine-automated. Whilst just a generalisation, it’s important to highlight how generalisations are intellectually necessary evils, but it’s also important to remember that we live in details.

It means that besides community conventions the field of Artificial Intelligence has many theoretical (in on-going research process) and practical shapes as well, they are: Narrow or Weak AI (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and SuperIntelligence. 

Let’s start with the first one: ANI (Narrow AI). This is the level we’re currently at, where the stage is dominated by GPT-4. Machines are able to perform a single (or narrow) task, often faster and better than a human. However, it cannot perform anything else. Also, the output of such agents is partially wrong or imprecise, requiring a strong understanding of prompt engineering in order to gain the best off of them. They can play music, analyse data, surf the web and get information, answer question and make art. This is the case of Midjourney, a ANI model that creates any type of art you ask it to do! Of course, as Midjourney itself, these models present ethical limitations (such as the ability of GPT-4 to generate malicious content or for DALL-E (art generation model) to represent gore and nudity).
