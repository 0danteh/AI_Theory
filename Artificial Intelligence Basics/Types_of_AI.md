# How AI is Transforming Our World

Artificial Intelligence is becoming more and more popular the more time passes, and people have used this term to refer to everything that is machine-automated. Whilst just a generalisation, it’s important to highlight how generalisations are intellectually necessary evils, but it’s also important to remember that we live in details.

It means that besides community conventions the field of Artificial Intelligence has many theoretical (in on-going research process) and practical shapes as well, they are: Narrow or Weak AI (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and SuperIntelligence.
