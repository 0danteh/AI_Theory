# From Myth to Machine: The History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (also known as AI), is a field of computer science that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks generally executed through intelligence-related reasoning (both convergent (logical) and divergent (creative) thinking); such as: perception, decision making and natural language processing.

Since the dawn of humankind, people from every land of the world have always wondered on artificial beings who can think and act by themselves. The narration process of said scenarios was expressed through the developement of myths (term that comes from the Greek word "μῦθος" (mûthos), which means "story," "tale," or "narrative”).
