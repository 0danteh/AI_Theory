# From Myth to Machine: The History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (also known as AI), is a field of computer science that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks generally executed through intelligence-related reasoning (both convergent (logical) and divergent (creative) thinking); such as: perception, decision making and natural language processing.

Since the dawn of humankind, people from every land of the world have always wondered on artificial beings who can think and act by themselves. The narration process of said scenarios was expressed through the developement of myths (term that comes from the Greek word "μῦθος" (mûthos), which means "story," "tale," or "narrative”). 

For example, in ancient Egypt, there was a legend about the god Thoth, who was the inventor of writing, mathematics, and magic. He created a living statue of a baboon that could speak and solve problems. He also made a mechanical ibis bird that could fly and report what it saw. Another one, instead, tell the story of the ancient Indian sage Vishwakarma, who was the architect of the gods. He built a flying chariot for the sun god Surya, and also created mechanical animals and birds that could move and act like real ones. He also made a golden lotus that could bloom and close according to the sun’s movement. 

Besides this broad and long-lasting desire of artificial innovation for the aid of human’s life, it is important to note that the modern concept of AI emerged in the mid-20th century, when a group of researchers (such as: Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon etc…) developed the foundations of computation, logic, and information theory. The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during a conference on how to develop machines that can handle automated reasoning processes by themselves.
